Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets (also called supercenters), discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company was founded by Sam Walton in nearby Rogers, Arkansas in 1962 and incorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law on October 31, 1969. It also owns and operates Sam's Club retail warehouses. In India, Walmart operates under the name of Flipkart Wholesale.

Throughout the year, Walmart hosts a number of promotional markdown sales. The four biggest holidays—the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas—are preceded by these markdowns. The evaluation gives five times more weight to the weeks that include certain holidays than the ones that don't. Modelling the effects of markdowns on these holiday periods in the absence of complete/ideal historical data is one of the challenges this competition presents. There are 45 Walmart locations spread throughout several regions, and historical sales information is accessible.

Walmart is the world's largest company by revenue, with about US$570 billion in annual revenue, according to the Fortune Global 500 list in May 2022.

Walmart, one of the top retailers in the US, would like to make accurate sales and demand predictions. Each day, specific occasions and holidays have an impact on sales. Data on sales are available for 45 Walmart locations. Unforeseen demand is a hurdle for the company, and occasionally stock runs out because of a bad machine learning system. A perfect machine learning algorithm will precisely estimate demand and take into account variables like the CPI, unemployment rate, and other economic indicators.

Conventional retail stores still play a prominent role in a world dominated by Ecommerce. Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit. From groceries to clothing to electronics, customers keep flooding the gates of retail stores to satisfy their needs. As time has passed, retailers have had to evolve in order to keep up with changes in demands and the ever-changing mindset of customers. One such retail industry juggernaut that has kept up with the demands of customers as well changed the face of the retail industry for the better is Walmart Inc.
